# Simple NFT Marketplace

This project provides sample code to build a simple NFT
([Non-Fungible Token](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/nfts-explained/))
based marketplace with Amazon Managed Blockchain.

NFTs are cryptoassets in which each token is unique, and therefore able to create a relationship, or contract,
between a specific unique token, and a specific asset - including physical asset, virtual asset and more.
This contract allows ownership of a digital asset to be proven.  For this reason, NFTs are also known as *deeds*.

While there are multiple standards for non-fungible tokens, this exercise will use
the Ethereum Blockchain network, and ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens.

To be able to create the required contracts, we will:
1. Create a Node connected to a Blockchain network
2. Manually Generate, verify and deploy a contract.
3. Deploy an API to automate the process
4. Create a Front End that utilizes the API
5. Deploy the MarketPlace Front End

You will use the following tool set:
- Git, and your OS Command Line
- Node.js and npm
- the AWS CLI and AWS Console
- AWS CDK to deploy backend API ([/provision](/provision))
- Contract written in Solidity ([/contract](/contract))
- Marketplace web UI ([/marketplace](/marketplace))

Do NOT use this codes in your production workloads.
